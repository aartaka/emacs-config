# Emacs customizations

I'm trying to take as much of my necessities and work into Emacs, because it's the best operating system, by coincidence having a decent text editor. And, although it's an [enslaved lisp machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/LispMemes/comments/dgoj02/fun_fact_gnu_emacs_is_mostly_c/), it's, unfortunately, the best of what we have now.

I had home-grown package-management functions before I moved to `use-package`. Now I don't. Most of the code is either copy-pasted or inspired by the work of others. Some pieces of copy-paste even have the links to the original habitat of the borrowed code.

Also, because Guix provides me with the `environment` command, I'm thinking of splitting the config file into several ones -- for coding, academic work and daily tasks, for example.
